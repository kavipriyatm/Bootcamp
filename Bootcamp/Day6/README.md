## Task 1: Housing Price Regression

### What I Learned:
- Implemented a regression model using a housing dataset.
- Split data into features (X) and target (y).
- Used a Sequential model with one input and one output layer.
- Compiled with RMSprop optimizer and MSE loss.
- Trained for 20 epochs and plotted loss.

### Challenges Faced:
- Selecting a suitable dataset.
- Handling overfitting and underfitting.

### Dataset Used:
- **Name:** California Housing Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle

## Task 2: Digit Recognition

### What I Learned:
- Flattened 28x28 images into 784 inputs.
- Used one-hot encoding for labels.
- Defined a Sequential model with Softmax activation.
- Compiled with categorical crossentropy loss.
- Trained for 10 epochs and evaluated accuracy.

### Challenges Faced:
- Data preprocessing and normalization.

### Dataset Used:
- **Name:** Digit Recognizer Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle

## Task 3: Batch Size Adjustment

### What I Learned:
- Tested batch sizes of 16, 32, and 64.
- Observed effects on training and validation loss.
- Understood mini-batch gradient descent.

### Challenges Faced:
- Balancing batch size for stability.

### Dataset Used:
- **Name:** California Housing Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle
